//! Chess board supporting standard chess and Chess960 
//! 
//! A _board_ represents the state of a chess board and provides
//! the core mechanisms to play or to review a game of chess. The
//! following features are supported:
//! 
//! [x] Standard chess rules
//! [x] Chess960 rules
//! [x] Track and automatically apply (or discard) pre-moves
//! [x] Enforce three-fold repetition rule
//! [ ] Enforce five-fold repetition rule
//! [x] Enforce fifty-move rule
//! [x] Recognize insuffient mating material (using chess.com's heuristics)
//! [ ] Time Controls
//! [x] Engine mode (see below for description)
//! [x] Player mode (see below for description)
//! [x] Review prior positions
//! [ ] Take backs (still need to look into configuration options)
//! [ ] Recognize some dead positions (unlikely to implement this fully)
//! [ ] Other chess variants such as Crazyhouse, 3-Check, etc.
//! 
//! Some of the key abstractions include:
//! 
//! * A `Square` represents the coordinates for a single square
//!   on an 8-by-8 board. The 8 rows and 8 columns on a board 
//!   are represented by `Rank` (`Rank1` .. `Rank8`) and `File`
//!   ('FileA' .. 'FileH') respectively. Each square is uniquely
//!   identified by a rank and a file and is named using the letter of
//!   the file followed by the number of the rank (e.g. `A1` .. `H8`).
//! 
//! * A `Mask` is a 64-bit (u64) value in which each bit maps to a
//!   square on the board. Masks are useful for efficiently representing
//!   which squares contain pawns, for instance, or which squares are
//!   legal move destinations for a piece. Masks can be combined or
//!   modified using bitwise `|`, `|=`, `&`, `&=` and `!` operators. 
//!   The `iter()` method provides an efficient double-ended iterator.
//! 
//! * `Material` represents a piece of a specific color. A `Piece` has
//!   six variants: `King`, `Queen`, `Rook`, `Bishop`, `Knight` and `Pawn`.
//!   `Color` is either `White` or `Black`. Note that in order to 
//!   support pawn promotion moves, there's another type called 
//!   `Promotion` with only four variants: `Queen`, `Rook`, `Bishop`,
//!   and `Knight`. `Piece` and `Promotion` are different types but
//!   you can convert from one to the other using `From<Promotion>`
//!   and `TryFrom<Piece>`.
//! 
//! * A `Position` holds the state of the board, including the contents
//!   of each square, whose turn it is, how many moves have been
//!   played, etc. There are only two public methods that modify a 
//!   position: `apply_move` and `apply_pre_move`. The first applies
//!   a `LegalMove` and toggles the turn. The second updates the 
//!   contents of the squares to reflect a `PreMove` but does not
//!   toggle the turn. Note that there is no mechanism to undo or 
//!   roll back a position to a previous state. That functionality
//!   is handled by `ReviewState` which holds onto all historical 
//!   positions (indirectly via `MoveState`).
//! 
//! * `MoveState` encapsulates a single position but also tracks 
//!   the squares that are attacking or being attacked by other
//!   squares. Ultimately `MoveState` is responsible for identfying
//!   which moves are legal for a given position and to do this,
//!   it must know if the king is in check or a piece is pinned.
//!   `MoveState` implements `apply_move` and `apply_pre_move` so 
//!   it can update it's own state after delegating to the
//!   corresponding methods in its contained position.
//! 
//! * `ReviewState` is used to efficiently step backward or forward
//!   through the historical positions in a game. It contains a list
//!   of `MoveState`s and supports skipping directly to the starting
//!   position or the end or to any in the middle. It can be cloned
//!   and/or truncated to support "take-back" functionality.
//!   
//! * This crate supports two modes of play: `EngineBoard` and
//!   `PlayerBoard`. An `EngineBoard` plays both sides of a game,
//!   applying successive moves of alternating color. It is designed
//!   to be used by an engine or a server that receives and applies
//!   moves from each player in turn. No pre-moves or reviewing prior 
//!   positions is allowed. A `PlayerBoard` plays one side of a game.
//!   It holds on to `ReviewState` and tracks pre-moves (automatically
//!   applying or discarding them after receiving an opponent's move).
